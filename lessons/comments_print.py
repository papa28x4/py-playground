Comments
'''


# Comments can be used to provide explanation for a line or block of code. This improves
# the readability for you and others. The python interpreter skips comments and does not
# attempt to execute them. Because of the above, comments can also be used to temporarily
# make certain parts of our code inactive. This is useful when debugging as it can help us
# narrow down where the bug is coming from.

# To comment a line of code in python, we use the hash symbol (#). E.g

# To print out to the terminal, we use the print function
print('Hello World')


# To comment out multiple lines we use either triple single quotes or triple double quotes
'''
print('a')
print('b')
print('c')

"""
print('a')

Print Function
'''

# Print is to Python what console.log is to Javascript
# With the Print function, you can output the result of variables, functions, classes etc


# When you have multiple print statements, it's a good idea to tag them so
# you'd easily identify which line is being printed


# Print by default puts a line return or \n after each print. This makes each print statement
# output content on a new line. This is the default behaviour. It can be changed by supplying
# a different value to the "end" argument



'''
Print options
sep = "|",
end = "", the default: "/n"

help(print)
Also works for your own function
